# 🔍 Crime Prediction and Analysis System (CRIMINOVA)

A machine learning web application that predicts the likelihood and type of crime based on user-input location and time.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses historical crime data, geolocation, and machine learning (Random Forest Classifier) to help predict possible crime types at specific locations and times. It was developed as an academic project to explore the use of AI in proactive crime prevention.

## 🛠️ Features

- 📍 Location-based crime prediction using geocoding
- ⏰ Time-sensitive prediction based on patterns (day, month, hour)
- 🎯 Machine learning with Random Forest Classifier
- 📊 Data preprocessing and feature engineering using Pandas and NumPy
- 🌐 Web interface using Flask and HTML
- 📈 Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, Joblib  
- Flask  
- Geopy (for geocoding)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## 🚀 Project Modules

1. **Data Processing Module**
   - Cleaned and transformed timestamped crime data
   - Extracted features: year, month, day, hour, weekday

2. **ML Module**
   - Trained a Random Forest Classifier
   - Saved model using `joblib`
   - Evaluated with accuracy score and classification report

3. **Web App Module**
   - Flask app with forms for input (location + time)
   - Displayed crime type prediction using trained model
   - Used HTML templates to show output clearly

## 📊 Sample Visuals (if available)
*(You can upload screenshots from your report or create new ones later)*

- Heatmaps of crime occurrence
- Monthly/daily crime frequency distribution
- Web app UI (input form and prediction result)
